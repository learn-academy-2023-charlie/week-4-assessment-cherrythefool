# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:
object-oriented programming allows for a more encapsulation, which gives an easier way to make changes to the program without causing problems.

Researched answer:
Object-oriented programming is a response to complexity - it centers storing information around objects, allowing encapsulation of the access of and change to information.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A float is a number which carries digits past a decimal point (e.g. 3.14159) while an integer is a whole number (e.g. 3)

Researched answer:
A float is a number which carries digits past a decimal point (e.g. 3.14159) while an integer is a whole number (e.g. 3). This differs from language to language, for example in Javascript both are numbers.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return means that ruby will automatically use the last line in a function as the return.

Researched answer:
The keyword is return is not always needed in Ruby, which is known as implicit return. Ruby will automatically use the last line in a function as the return.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby is similar to the javascript concepts of method and built-in function - it is like a built-in and used in a method.

Researched answer:
A block is an anoonymous function passed to a method in Ruby, and is typically wraped in curly brackets or a "do"/"end". It is kind of like a stored snippet of functionality.

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: A hash is similar to an array of objects, and items are accessed similarly - using dot notation and the name of the hash.

Researched answer: 
A hash is similar to an array of objects in javascript, and like an array of objects stores key-value pairs. The values of the pairs in the hash can be accessed for use in several ways, for example with the hash and key names, or simply the hash name and "keys" with dot notation.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: RSpec is a testing framework for Ruby. It stands for "request specification" and focuses on object behavior.

2. Test-driven development: Test driven development is code development focused on input and output, in contrast to RSpecs behavior driven development, which focuses on how the code functions when put into use. 

3. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL (or just Postgres) is a structured query language used with relational databases.

4. CRUD: CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete and refers to types of data manipulation, which is especially relevant with Ruby hashes but also in a broader scope.

5. HTTP: HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and refers to the language protocol for info passing between internet users and servers.
